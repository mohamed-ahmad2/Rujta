# Welcome to Rujta Developer Documentation

Rujta is a modern web application built with **.NET 8** on the backend and **React** on the frontend. It enables users to browse and order pharmacy products, including medicines, cotton, and other essentials. Key features include adding items to a cart, checking stock availability across pharmacies, and placing orders.

Pharmacies benefit from a dedicated dashboard to manage inventory, track orders, and monitor statuses such as Pending, Processing, or Delivered.

Future enhancements include AI-powered prescription analysis and additional tools to streamline user experiences and pharmacy operations.

This documentation is tailored for developers, contributors, and maintainers seeking to understand, deploy, or extend the project.
