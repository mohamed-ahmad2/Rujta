# Welcome to Rujta Dev Docs

Rujta is a .NET 8 + React project that allows users to browse and order pharmacy products such as medicines, cotton, and other pharmacy items. Users can add products to their cart, view which pharmacies have them in stock, and place orders.  

Pharmacies can manage their products and track orders through a dedicated dashboard, where they can see order statuses like Pending, Processing, or Delivered.  

Future features will include AI-powered prescription reading and other enhancements to improve user experience and pharmacy operations.

This documentation is intended for developers and contributors who want to understand, use, or contribute to the project.
